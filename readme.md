# 🚀 30-Day Go + DevOps + Backend Engineering Roadmap

Master Go by building real-world tools, APIs, and real-time systems in just 30 days. From DevOps to distributed systems — one task at a time.

---

### 🔧 Days 1–30

 | Day | Task |
 |-----|------|
 | 1 | 🛠️ Setup Go workspace, print OS & Go runtime info |
 | 2 | 🧬 Create `SysStats` struct, encode as JSON |
 | 3 | 🌐 Build a concurrent ping tool using goroutines & channels |
 | 4 | 🧾 Read YAML config, run `docker ps`, log output |
 | 5 | 📈 Monitor CPU/RAM usage, expose Prometheus-style `/metrics` |
 | 6 | 🐳 List Docker containers using Docker SDK in Go |
 | 7 | ☸️ Create and delete Kubernetes pods using `client-go` |
 | 8 | 📦 Collect and forward logs via HTTP (log aggregator) |
 | 9 | ⚙️ Build CLI to load `.env`, validate, and inject vars |
| 10 | 🚨 Monitor & send webhook alerts (DevOps alert bot) |
| 11 | 🛡️ Build REST API with logging and authentication middleware |
| 12 | 📚 Create full CRUD Bookstore API using Gorilla Mux |
| 13 | 🗃️ Integrate PostgreSQL using GORM/pgx with migrations |
| 14 | 🔐 Add JWT login & protected routes |
| 15 | 🧼 Refactor API using Clean Architecture principles |
| 16 | ⏳ Add rate limiting middleware (`ulule/limiter`) |
| 17 | ✅ Write unit tests and mocks for handlers/services |
| 18 | 🔄 Build WebSocket echo server (`gorilla/websocket`) |
| 19 | 🗨️ Implement multi-user WebSocket chat room |
| 20 | ⚡ Add Redis caching to API |
| 21 | 📢 Redis Pub/Sub to notify WebSocket clients on DB changes |
| 22 | 📬 Kafka producer/consumer with `kafka-go` |
| 23 | 🧵 Worker pool to process Kafka jobs concurrently |
| 24 | 📹 WebRTC signaling server using `pion/webrtc` |
| 25 | 📊 Real-time dashboard with REST + WebSocket + Redis + Kafka |
| 26 | 🪵 Add structured logging with Zap and pass trace IDs |
| 27 | 📈 Expose Prometheus `/metrics` for all endpoints |
| 28 | 💬 Build gRPC `UserService` |
| 29 | 🛰️ Create reverse proxy with service discovery |
| 30 | 🚀 Capstone: Dockerized system with REST, WebSocket, Redis, Kafka, gRPC + CI/CD pipeline and documentation |

---

### ✅ Final Outcome

- 🔧 Infrastructure tools in Go  
- 🌐 Fully tested REST + WebSocket + gRPC services  
- 📊 Real-time systems using Redis, Kafka, WebRTC  
- 🐳 Dockerized setup with CI/CD & Prometheus metrics  
- 🧼 Clean code, logs, traceability, and service discovery
